# Calgary-Wallpaper

Script that changes your wallpaper based on current calgary conditions such as time of day, season, and weather. 
The images are pulled directly from pexel so sometimes the images might not be the best. In those cases I'd
recommend running the script again to get a better image

for the script to work you must have a pexel key and enter it in line 18. You must also pip install pexels-api

pip install pexels-api
